# Status Network Token Audit

## Preamble
This audit report was undertaken by BlockchainLabs.nz for the purpose of providing feedback to Status Research & Development Gmbh. It has subsequently been shared publicly without any express or implied warranty.

Solidity contracts were sourced from the public Github repo [status-im/status-network-token](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token) as at commit [a1aa79b34c9e99a81a59b3cd8103c4f2a41cfc3b](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/tree/a1aa79b34c9e99a81a59b3cd8103c4f2a41cfc3b) - we would encourage all community members and token holders to make their own assessment of the contracts.

## Scope
All Solidity code contained in [/contracts](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/tree/master/contracts) was considered in scope along with the tests contained in [/test](https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/tree/master/test) as a basis for static and dynamic analysis.

## Focus Areas
The audit report is focused on the following key areas - though this is *not an exhaustive list*.

#### Correctness
* No correctness defects uncovered during static analysis?
* No implemented contract violations uncovered during execution?
* No other generic incorrect behavior detected during execution?
* Adherence to adopted standards such as ERC20?

#### Testability
* Test coverage across all functions and events?
* Test cases for both expected behaviour and failure modes?
* Settings for easy testing of a range of parameters?
* No reliance on nested callback functions or console logs?
* Avoidance of test scenarios calling other test scenarios?

#### Security
* No presence of known security weaknesses?
* No funds at risk of malicious attempts to withdraw/transfer?
* No funds at risk of control fraud?
* Prevention of Integer Overflow or Underflow?

#### Best Practice
* Explicit labeling for the visibility of functions and state variables?
* Proper management of gas limits and nested execution?
* Latest version of the Solidity compiler?

## Classification

#### Defect Severity
* **Minor** - A defect that does not have a material impact on the contract execution and is likely to be subjective.
* **Moderate** - A defect that could impact the desired outcome of the contract execution in a specific scenario.
* **Major** - A defect that impacts the desired outcome of the contract execution or introduces a weakness that may be exploited.
* **Critical** - A defect that presents a significant security vulnerability or failure of the contract across a range of scenarios.

## Findings
#### Minor


==1==

While testing SGTExchanger, we found that it was possible for a user with no SGT tokens to call the collect() function. It was also possible for a user with SGT tokens to call the collect() function for a second time, after having already collected their SNT.

However, this is a minor issue because in both cases no SNT was issued.

Since commit 450fbc85fd7a4a0dc17d22fc7a6ab5071277fb46, PR 106 on 16th June an exception is now thrown:
https://github.com/status-im/status-network-token/pull/106

==2==

Test checking for failures where encapsulated within a `catch` and where never properly evaluated. The fix for this issue was addressed on status-im/status-network-token#70 and later improved on status-im/status-network-token#133

#### Moderate

#### Major

==1==

Current implementation of MiniMeToken is vulnerable to ERC20 Short Address 'Attack'

While this isn't a critical issue as it only comes into play with user error, we suggest making the fix to MiniMeToken.

A simple fix would be to add a modifier to check address size, and apply this modifier to the transfer function of the MiniMeToken:

    modifier onlyPayloadSize(uint size) {
       assert(msg.data.length == size + 4);
       _;
    }

  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
    //function body unchanged
  }   

==2==

The function collectTokens on the DevTokensHolder contract will mistakenly floor the division of any period of time by 24 months. Making it impossible for developers to collect any token until 2 years. The fix was merged on status-im/status-network-token#105

#### Critical


## Conclusion
_Conclusions will be drafted upon completion of the audit & testing required for this report_
